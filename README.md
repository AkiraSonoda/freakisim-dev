Welcome to OpenSim Arriba!

# Overview

OpenSim Arriba is a fork derived from OpenSim.

OpenSim is a BSD Licensed Open Source project to develop a functioning
virtual worlds server platform capable of supporting multiple clients
and servers in a heterogeneous grid structure. OpenSim is written in
C#, and can run under Mono or the Microsoft .NET runtimes.

In case the compile fails please use the arribasim-libs repo to compile those libs.

The libs required in that case are:
* C5.dll
* CSJ2K.dll
* HttpServer.dll
* PrimMesher.dll
* SmartThreadPool.dll
* ThreadedClasses.dll
* Warp3D.dll

REMARKS ABOUT HAVING THE FORK ON MAINTENANCE MODE:

Since the main interest is to keep it stable now:
If no one comes up with relevant requests or other necessary requirements,
it can happen that there is no commit for a while.

Most time is now allocated to a rewrite instead of using eventually some decades to find all the mess left.
